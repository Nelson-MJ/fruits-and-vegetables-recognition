The project integrates several key technologies to accomplish its objectives. Streamlit is employed, a Python library, as the framework for building an interactive and intuitive user interface. 
TensorFlow, a leading deep learning framework, serves as the backbone for training and deploying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. 
Furthermore, the project harnesses the collaborative power of Google Colab, a cloud-based development environment, for seamless development and deployment.
The project aims to deliver a comprehensive fruit and vegetable recognition system that combines the simplicity of Streamlit, the computational prowess of NumPy and TensorFlow, and the visualization capabilities of Matplotlib.
